![GMAIL3 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113187996/220174079-aaa271bf-9422-40af-894b-fb864988c172.jpg)

This is a decentralized email application that uses the Ethereum blockchain for secure and decentralized storage. It is built using Vite.js and leverages various smart contracts to store email data on the blockchain.

## Main Problems Resolved

1. **Data Privacy:** Traditional email services store your emails and personal data on centralized servers, which can be vulnerable to hacking or data breaches. This decentralized email application solves this problem by storing all data on the secure and decentralized Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that your data is safe and private.

2. **Censorship Resistance:** Centralized email services are susceptible to censorship, where governments or other authorities can block or restrict access to certain emails or even entire email services. This decentralized email application uses the Ethereum blockchain, which is resistant to censorship and ensures that your emails are always accessible.

3. **Trust and Security:** With centralized email services, you have to trust that the service provider is handling your data securely and not misusing it. This decentralized email application uses smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain to ensure that your data is secure and that all email interactions are transparent and auditable.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Start the application using `npm run dev`.

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This decentralized email application solves some of the biggest problems with traditional email services, including data privacy, censorship resistance, and trust and security. It offers a secure and private way to send and receive emails, while ensuring that your data is always under your control.
